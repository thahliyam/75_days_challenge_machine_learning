75 Days of Machine Learning Challenge
This repository documents my journey through 75 days of hands-on learning in Machine Learning. Each day, I tackle real-world problems and concepts, covering topics such as data preprocessing, supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, decision trees, random forests, model evaluation, feature engineering, and deep learning basics. The challenge not only strengthens my technical skills in Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools, but also builds consistency and problem-solving abilities. My goal is to create a strong foundation in ML, share my progress openly, and inspire others who want to grow in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
